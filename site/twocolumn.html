Metaphor could be regarded as a literature device (Carter 2004) and defined as making use of a conceptual domain to understand another conceptual domain (Kovecses 2010). It is in ‘The sea and the sky were welded together without a joint’ in HD. The literary meaning of this metaphor is the blending of the sea and the sky, while the edge is blurred. The merge of the sea and sky is metaphorised as metals are perfectly welded together with no joint. This portrait of welding could be regarded as pattern reforming that the linguistic manipulation restructures our usual perception about the sea and the sky. By applying the metaphor, it seems to us that the sea line separating the sea and the sky is vanished or unseen, which implies the unclearness of the sea-sky view. This unclearness supports the meaning of vagueness of the whole picture which is depicted in the book Hear of Darkness by Conrad (Stubbs 2005). 
In RT, which is a news report, metaphor is also in “Standing statue still on the shoreline, the heron is almost impossible to spot against the reeds behind it”. The literary meaning is clear that the heron is standing still like a statue stands statically. The steady standing of the heron is metophrised as a still statue. The linguistic manipulation of depicting the standing of heron exploits our shared knowledge of the inanimate feature of statues. Therefore, the reporter manipulates the common knowledge to bring convergence between writer and reader by reforming the linguistic construction. As a result, the metaphorical use emphasizes the still image constructed in the text.

Personification (a figure of speech where animals, ideas or inorganic objects are given human characteristics) is in “The Nellie, … swung to her anchor…, and was at rest … the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide”. The yawl, instead her anchor is thrown by the crew and parked aside in the pier to be ready to set off, is personified to be able to swing to her anchor, rest, and wait for the tide’s coming. The description of the yawl realizes the yawl as a person with the human pronoun ‘her’ (though is common to use her to refer to ship) is able to move herself but at a passive state. And she is resting and waiting for the forthcoming. This not only gives animation to the boat, but also adds a passive and negative personality which only human beings would possess. 
Personification is also in RT as “In 1957, the pollution levels became so bad that the River Thames was declared biologically dead.” Normally, only human beings are able to be declared dead if suffer serious injuries. However, by reforming the pattern of usual use, the reporter intentionally compares the river to a lively person. This comparison not only injects life to the River Thames, but also exaggerates the worsening condition of the polluted. As a result the picture of the River Thames which is ecological damaged as a lively person who is harmed to be biologically dead is vividly presented before readers. Therefore, pattern reforming by the use of personification reinforcing the meaning of the death of the river.
