<h1>Metaphor</h1>
<P style="font-size: .5em;">
Metaphor could be regarded as a literature device (Carter 2004) and defined as making use of a conceptual domain to understand another conceptual domain (Kovecses 2010). It is in ‘The sea and the sky were welded together without a joint’ in HD. The literary meaning of this metaphor is the blending of the sea and the sky, while the edge is blurred. The merge of the sea and sky is metaphorised as metals are perfectly welded together with no joint. This portrait of welding could be regarded as pattern reforming that the linguistic manipulation restructures our usual perception about the sea and the sky. By applying the metaphor, it seems to us that the sea line separating the sea and the sky is vanished or unseen, which implies the unclearness of the sea-sky view. This unclearness supports the meaning of vagueness of the whole picture which is depicted in the book Hear of Darkness by Conrad (Stubbs 2005).

In RT, which is a news report, metaphor is also in “Standing statue still on the shoreline, the heron is almost impossible to spot against the reeds behind it”. The literary meaning is clear that the heron is standing still like a statue stands statically. The steady standing of the heron is metophrised as a still statue. The linguistic manipulation of depicting the standing of heron exploits our shared knowledge of the inanimate feature of statues. Therefore, the reporter manipulates the common knowledge to bring convergence between writer and reader by reforming the linguistic construction. As a result, the metaphorical use emphasizes the still image constructed in the text.
