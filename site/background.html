<h1>The Backgound Property</h1>

<div id="bg">Nominalization, which could be regarded as one type of morphological deviation, is the process of turning a word from one grammatical word class into the word class of noun. For instance, “flatness” in ‘a haze rested on the low shore that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness’, trustworthiness in ‘he resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified,’ and flutter in ‘swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails’. These reforming of the part of speech could reinforce the state of inactivity portrayed in the text. For instance, instead of ‘swung to her anchor without fluttering the sails’, Conrad used ‘without a flutter of the sails’ to avoid using ‘flutter’ as a verb to reinforce the quietness of the scene that even ‘a flutter’ is nowhere to be seen.</div>
