	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Jacobson suggested that in the system of language, there are different kinds of inherent functions. One of that is poetic function which is prototypical in literature work. The canon of literature possesses the poetic function which is regarded as the aesthetic value of language. The value realized in its ability to draw attention to the language itself (Jacobson , Thornborrow 2007). Carter (2004) regarded this as the inherent approach of exploring literariness that language has the meaning for its own sake. Moreover, he states that creativity is not about yes or not, it is a continuum. There is only more or less literature/creativity rather than a discrete set of features. The construction of creativity is interdependent on some of the determining factors such as function of texts, register of texts, and interpersonal relationship between sender and receiver (Carter 2004). As found that numerous techniques which are frequently identified in literature work can also be found in every day situation (Carter 2004). He then classified two types of creative linguistic features which to a certain extern cover Jacobson’s poetic function of language such as metaphor, neologism, and simile, etc.. These two types are pattern reforming and pattern reinforcing. Pattern reforming refers to the deviation from the expected linguistic pattern; while pattern reinforcing refers the expected regularities in reinforcing the linguistic meaning (Carter 2004). In the following essay, I will identify the possible literary/creative features in a fictional text: an excerpt from Hard of Darkness (HD in short for the following) and a non-fictional text: a news report “The clean up of the River Thames” from The Telegraph (RT in short for the following) by adopting the categorization of pattern reforming and reinforcing to propose that literary/creativity in literature is not only restrict to fictional text, but also possessed by non-fictional text. 
		Pattern reforming and pattern reinforcing concern the linguistic manipulation in creating an effect which draws attention to language itself. Pattern reforming manifests in linguistic irregularities which deviate the standard language patterns. This deviation involves deliberate manipulation to accentuate the language to its self and adds more to the language in strengthening the literary/creative value of the text.  I will examine how Metaphor, Personification, Syntactical Inversion, Morphological Deviation, and Nominalization which are identified in the two texts contribute to literary/creative value. On the other Hand, Pattern reinforcing manifests in linguistic regularities which conform to the existing linguistic structures. This type of regularities may also add more to the language (though may not be as overt as pattern reforming) and reinforce the coherence of the text to increase the literary/creative value. I will examine how ordinary linguistic structures found in the two texts display literary/creative features.

<h2>Pattern Reforming</h2>
<h3 id="metaphor">Metaphor</h3>
<p>
	Metaphor could be regarded as a literature device (Carter 2004) and defined as making use of a conceptual domain to understand another conceptual domain (Kovecses 2010). It is in ‘The sea and the sky were welded together without a joint’ in HD. The literary meaning of this metaphor is the blending of the sea and the sky, while the edge is blurred. The merge of the sea and sky is metaphorised as metals are perfectly welded together with no joint. This portrait of welding could be regarded as pattern reforming that the linguistic manipulation restructures our usual perception about the sea and the sky. By applying the metaphor, it seems to us that the sea line separating the sea and the sky is vanished or unseen, which implies the unclearness of the sea-sky view. This unclearness supports the meaning of vagueness of the whole picture which is depicted in the book Hear of Darkness by Conrad (Stubbs 2005).
	<div></div> 
	In RT, which is a news report, metaphor is also in “Standing statue still on the shoreline, the heron is almost impossible to spot against the reeds behind it”. The literary meaning is clear that the heron is standing still like a statue stands statically. The steady standing of the heron is metophrised as a still statue. The linguistic manipulation of depicting the standing of heron exploits our shared knowledge of the inanimate feature of statues. Therefore, the reporter manipulates the common knowledge to bring convergence between writer and reader by reforming the linguistic construction. As a result, the metaphorical use emphasizes the still image constructed in the text.
</p>
<h3 id="personification">Personification</h3>
<p>Personification (a figure of speech where animals, ideas or inorganic objects are given human characteristics) is in “The Nellie, … swung to her anchor…, and was at rest … the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide”. The yawl, instead her anchor is thrown by the crew and parked aside in the pier to be ready to set off, is personified to be able to swing to her anchor, rest, and wait for the tide’s coming. The description of the yawl realizes the yawl as a person with the human pronoun ‘her’ (though is common to use her to refer to ship) is able to move herself but at a passive state. And she is resting and waiting for the forthcoming. This not only gives animation to the boat, but also adds a passive and negative personality which only human beings would possess. <div></div>
Personification is also in RT as “In 1957, the pollution levels became so bad that the River Thames was declared biologically dead.” Normally, only human beings are able to be declared dead if suffer serious injuries. However, by reforming the pattern of usual use, the reporter intentionally compares the river to a lively person. This comparison not only injects life to the River Thames, but also exaggerates the worsening condition of the polluted. As a result the picture of the River Thames which is ecological damaged as a lively person who is harmed to be biologically dead is vividly presented before readers. Therefore, pattern reforming by the use of personification reinforcing the meaning of the death of the river.</p>
<h3 id="given-new">Given-new Construction and Syntactic Inversion</h3>
<p>Given-new construction is commonly used to deliver message. Information transmission often follows the pattern of given followed by new information. However, in HD, the violation of the given-new construction is in “The Nellie, cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails.’ Instead of starting with a common syntactic structure as “There was a cruising yawl, the Nellie, swung to …’, Conrad arranged the yawl at the initial position of the sentence by given the name “Nellie” to readers. This deviation from usual syntactic patterns forces readers to familiar themselves with the yawl. As a result, the existence of the yawl is foregrounded. The importance of the yawl is then reveled in the rest of the story that the characters of the story are sailors and the yawl is the transportation used to sail from Britain to the forest of Congo. <div></div>
Similar syntactic manipulation is also in the RT “Only once our boat draws near does the bird stir”. Instead of following the traditionally grammatical rules (subject followed by finite as in “only once our boat draws near, the bird does stir”), the reporter places the finite (does) in front of the subject (the bird). This deviation from traditional grammar creates the dramatic effect by emphasizing the unexpected movement made by the bird and the certainty that the bird stirs the tranquility of the scene to portrait the liveliness that brought by the birds to the nature.</p>
<h3 id="morphological">Morphological Deviation</h3>
<p>Morphological deviation refers to building blocks for words (Short 2011). It is identified in the fictional text. There are a few words morphologically altered by Conrad into another grammatical word class. “Cruising” in ‘a cruising yawl’, is a noun or verb in traditional grammar, but adjective. In order to describe the yawl’s purpose for cruise, the bound morpheme ‘ing’ is added to become an adjective as “cruising”. Hence, a cruising yawl functionally indicates the yawl is used for cruise. Similar manipulation also in “vanishing” in ‘ran out to sea in vanishing flatness’ that “Vanishing” as an adjective derives from “vanish” as a verb to describe “the state of the flat surface of the sea. And “condensed” is in ‘still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom’ that “condense” as a verb added with the suffix “ed” to function as an adjective. 
</p>
<h3 id="nominalization">Nominalization</h3>
<p>Nominalization, which could be regarded as one type of morphological deviation, is the process of turning a word from one grammatical word class into the word class of noun. For instance, “flatness” in ‘a haze rested on the low shore that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness’, trustworthiness in ‘he resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified,’ and flutter in ‘swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails’. These reforming of the part of speech could reinforce the state of inactivity portrayed in the text. For instance, instead of ‘swung to her anchor without fluttering the sails’, Conrad used ‘without a flutter of the sails’ to avoid using ‘flutter’ as a verb to reinforce the quietness of the scene that even ‘a flutter’ is nowhere to be seen. </p>
<section id="reinforcing"></section>
<h2 id="reinforcing">Pattern Reinforcing</h2>
<h3 id="copulative">Copulative Verbs</h3>
<p>In functional grammar, verbs are regarded as process and classified into different types. One of the types is relational process which is mainly realized by copulative verbs. Copulative verbs, which are regarded as process of being, have the potential to possess the value of attributive or identifying (Hannay & Vester 1990). In HD, copulative verbs function as a bridge to link darkness to the scene. For instance, “the yawl was at rest ”,“ the wind was calm, and “the air was dark”. With the help of the copulative verb “was”, “rest”, “calm”, and “dark” realized as complement to the subjects (the yawl, the wind, and the air). It seems the repetitive pattern of relational processes contributes passiveness or negativeness to the subjects. As a result, passive/negative features in relation to vagueness and darkness seems to be possessed by and could not be separated from the subjects/scene. This manifestation of darkness supports the theme of the book portraying the imagery of darkness (Stubbs 2005).</p>
<h3 id="intransitive">Intransitive Verbs</h3>
<p>The intransitive verbs in traditional grammar could be regarded as intransitive process which indicates the process of happening. Different from transitive process in which the grammatical subject impacts the grammatical object, intransitive process indicates the action enacted by the grammatical subject on its own (Li 2007). There is recurring use of intransitive verbs in HD. For example,<br>
“swing” in “The Nellie, … swung to her anchor”, <br>
“come” and “wait” in “the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide”, <br>
“stretch” in “The sea-reach of the Thames stretched”, <br>
“weld” in “the sea and the sky were welded”, <br>
“drift” in “the tanned sails of the barges drifting up”,<br>
“stand” in “the tide seemed to stand rest”,<br>
“rest” and “ran” in “A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea”.<br>
The intransitive verbs imply the action doing on its own without affect others, because no objects to suffer the impact created by the subjects. As shown above, all these intransitive verbs seem to send a message that although all subjects are animated, they are basically acting on their own without impacting any others. As a result, the non-impact of the animated subject generates of an imagery of quietness which may associate to the sense of passiveness. Even the verb “made” in “the flood had made”, which is commonly used as transitive, is used for its rare intransitive purpose in Nautical. Therefore, the reoccurrences of manipulation of intransitive grammatical constructions support the entire scene in the River Thames which is overcastted by darkness for the overall coherence of the text.
</p>
<h3 id="onomatopoeia">Onomatopoeia</h3>
<p>Onomatopoeia, refers to “the use of words whose sounds indicate their meaning” (Neumayr 1994) is in RT which is to add much to the meaning and help create the picture. The onomatopoeian word is “plop” in ‘there is the occasional plop as a fish breaks the surface’. The phonetic sound of “plop” is an imitation of the sound generated by fish when they break the surface of the river. This onomatopoeian implementation vividly displays the image of a fish breaking the water surface, which enables readers to imagine hearing the sound generated by the fish’s movement by reading or reading out the word ‘plop’. Therefore, the onomatopoeian word creates the picture depicted in the text by creating a hearing sense.

<section id="conclusion"></section>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the literary/creative features manifested in pattern reforming and reinforcing are found both in fictional text (HD) and non-fictional text (RT). Both texts seem to possess literariness. It may be a matter of whether which text contains more literariness. As suggested by Carter (2006) that literariness is a continuum and occurs in various types of texts, the fictional text may contains more linguistic features, while the non-fictional text contains less. There may be a question of why there is such a variation. This may relate to the function of the text and observable restrictions on the texts. The function of HD is to present the author’s ideological viewpoint of the world, while RT is more about the exchange of fact. HD, which is about the fictional world imagined by Conrad, is to create a spiritual connection with readers and present his ideology. Therefore, Conrad enjoys a high degree of manipulating the language by exploiting the language system without the observable rules. However, RT is a news report which has to observe the rules under the genre of journalism. Journalists may value the principles of clarity and simplicity in transmitting information. The reporter has to construct an informative text and is restricted to his professional. Although there is room for negotiation for journalism writings, the reporter is by all means bound by the genre of journalism which is expected by the public. Therefore, the news report may not be able to demonstrate more literary/creative features.</p>
